# spin-off-paintings
paintings derived from P1sonet(net art projects)
<h3>info</h3>
This is a painting series wherein we use traditional painting medium such as acrylic,oil and will be on canvas. This is to emulate a more traditional way of doing art. We will also try as much as possible use traditional human labor and skill in the creation of the painting as opposed to other painting exploration as we are using robots and automation. 
<br>
In this process we will copy the images generated from our net art and other computer generated projects. The projects include the Philippine Collagian series, Brunswick Project and other digital generative art projects.

<br>
<h3>Point of Departure</h3>
The difference with Gerry on this process is that the "model" artworks came from an existing or previous projects. Those projects are mostly digital based and generative.In the future we can explore more on how we can expound the process.
